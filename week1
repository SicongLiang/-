Definition:improving some performance measure with experience computed from data

PS：KDDCup数据挖掘比赛

Application in Entertainment:Recommender System 
eg. viewer and movie都描绘成一串特征数字做乘法得到分数
pattern：rating <-- viewer/movie factors
learning：known rating
       -->learned factors
       -->unknown rating prediction

BASIC Notations:
input x ∈ X(customer application)
output y ∈ Y(good/bad after approving credit card)
unknown pattern to be learned <--> target function:
 f: X --> Y(ideal credit approval formula)
data <--> training examples: D = {(x1,y1),(x2,y2),...,(xn,yn)}(historical records in bank)
hypothesis(假说) <--> skill with hopefully good performance:
 g: X--> Y('learned' formula to be used)
   {(xn,yn)} from f --> ML --> g
